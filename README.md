This repository contains a modular and scalable machine learning pipeline designed for classification tasks. The code is highly configurable, allowing it to be used with various datasets by simply updating file paths and column configurations. It supports preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization, making it a robust solution for data analysis and predictive modeling.
Key Features

 ** Dataset Imputation:**
        Supports mean imputation for numerical columns.
        Implements LOCF (Last Observation Carried Forward) for categorical data.
    **Data Preprocessing:**
        Scales features using StandardScaler.
        Splits data into training and testing sets.
    **Model Training and Evaluation:**
        Includes Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest models.
        Performs cross-validation and computes evaluation metrics (accuracy, ROC curves, etc.).
    **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
        Ready to integrate RandomizedSearchCV or GridSearchCV for optimization.
    **Visualization:**
        Generates ROC curves for model performance comparison.
        Plots feature importance for tree-based models.
    **Flexible Configuration:**
        Parameterized file paths, target column, and imputation strategies make the pipeline adaptable for any dataset.
        How to Use

**Clone the Repository:**
                  
    git clone 
    cd your-repository

Set Up Your Environment: Install the required Python libraries:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Update Configuration:

  Edit the script to include your dataset's file paths and column names:
  **input_filepath** for the input data file.
  **output_filepath** for saving the processed dataset.
  **mean_impute_cols** for numerical columns requiring mean imputation.
  **locf_impute_cols** for categorical columns requiring LOCF imputation.
  **target_col** for the name of the target variable.

Run the Script: Execute the script to preprocess your data, train models, and generate visualizations:

    python main.py
